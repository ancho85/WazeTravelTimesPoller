# Waze Travel Times Poller
**Lake County Division of Transportation (Illinois)** - [Lake County DOT](https://www.lakecountyil.gov/transportation)

**Lake County PASSAGE** - [Lake County PASSAGE](https://www.lakecountypassage.com)

Disclaimer: This program was created for the Lake County PASSAGE system. Please use at your own discretion.

**As of August 28th, 2020 -- there was a database schema change in the code. If you update the code and not the database structure,
the program will fail. Specfically, the 'routes' table has new text columns 'feed_id' and 'feed_name'. This is for better tracking of
multiple feeds.**

The purpose of this program is to help Waze CCP members process raw travel times data
provided by Waze. The program will get data from the Waze TT feed, process the data, archive it,
and send email alerts for any segments that are "congested".

This was originally built to work on Linux + Postgres, but we scaled it back to use SQLite, 
so it could be easily deployed on Windows or Linux. The plan is to add support back for Postgres soon.

**Note: LCDOT welcomes any modifications or enhancements that can benefit the system and code will be 
periodically reviewed and merged.**
